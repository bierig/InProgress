# FeedbackBox

This project is a minimalistic Web Application that uses Bootstrap for the frontend and PHP for the backend. It shows how to manipulate XML and JSON data to save data. FeedbackBox is meant as a simple showcase Web Application example to highlight a minimal but working layout without focusing too much on details and beauty. Enjoy!
